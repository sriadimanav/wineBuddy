I'm building a wine discovery app called Wine Buddy using React with TanStack
Router (v1) and file-based routing. The UI should work across mobile, desktop,
and kiosk screens (e.g., wine store terminals).

Tailwind CSS should NOT be used, but headless UI components (like shadcn, Radix
UI, or similar) are encouraged for maximum flexibility and accessibility.

Core Features:

- When a wine is scanned, the app should show:
- Vintage
- Winery
- Short wine description
- Region of origin
- Tasting notes (flavour, aroma)
- Grape variety
- Colour
- Alcohol content
- Sugar content
- Sommelier reviews & ratings
- Customer reviews & ratings
- Food pairing suggestions

Tech Stack Constraints:

- React (latest stable)
- TanStack Router (file-based routing)
- No Tailwind CSS
- Use headless UI components (e.g., shadcn, Radix UI, or custom)
- Maintain clean component architecture and scalable folder structure

Platform Support: The UI/UX should be designed to work seamlessly across:

- Mobile devices (iOS/Android)
- Desktop browsers
- Kiosk screens (e.g., in wine stores or tasting events)

App Screens: Home Screen - featured wines, top picks, and recent scans Scan
Screen - label/barcode scanner Wine Details Screen - comprehensive wine info
Favourites Screen - userâ€™s saved wines Profile Screen - user preferences and
settings Sign In / Sign Up Screens - authentication Onboarding Flow - tutorial
for first-time users FAQ / Help Section - guides and support

Gamification Elements (suggest or design): Looking to introduce fun and
rewarding elements to boost engagement. Ideas could include: Wine Explorer
Badges - earn badges for scanning wines from new regions, grape types, or
wineries Tasting Challenges - monthly quests to try wines with specific notes or
pairings Leaderboards - top users by scans, reviews, or badges Streak Rewards -
daily or weekly scanning/interaction streaks Wine Journal - personalized
timeline or diary of scanned and rated wines Referral Rewards - invite friends
to unlock exclusive wines or content

What I need:

- UI/UX mockup suggestions tailored for mobile, desktop, and kiosk.
- Ideas to further enhance features and gamify the experience.
- Optional: name suggestions, growth hacks, or monetization ideas.
